flag_data
=========
Data gathering package for the DymaFlight project. Records IMU data and camera feed, and also records 
timestamps using keyboard input to make syncing data easier.


More information on the project can be found [here] (https://sites.google.com/site/umdminirobotreu2014wu/).

To run the main program + IMU collection  - 
roslaunch flag_data master.launch 



Note on Marker Size
--------------
For marker size, the bigger the better - ideally ~8 inches. The bigger the marker,
the more accurate the results at long distances. Check http://www.artoolworks.com/support/library/How\_ARToolKit\_works.
